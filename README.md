# Flight Performance in US

## by Neibo Augustine Olobo



## Details for project


> The Data Analyst Nanodegree program at Udacity is where this project was completed. This project's goal was to methodically analyze a dataset using Python visualization packages. Single variable exploration is followed by bivariate and multivariate analysis in the analysis.

> This study is followed by a succinct presentation that uses explanatory data analysis to communicate and emphasize key results. A tale was created for the readers to grasp what was found, and a slide deck that followed the main trail of exploration was made.
## Dataset details 
> The Udacity list was used to choose this dataset. In the US, the dataset Flights is used to provide flight performance metrics. The data examined and examined ranges from 2005 to 2007. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics' official website has the statistics.

## Summary of Findings

> After examining this data, we discovered that carrier or weather-related issues were the main causes of delays. From 2006 to 2008, American Airlines has the most delays and cancellations of any airline. Graphs and charts have been used throughout the presentation to demonstrate this.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> We may trace the timeline of delays and cancellations while watching the presentation and compare the plots that were chosen. Both of these metrics have been investigated and highlighted in the presentation since they may be used to evaluate carrier performance.
